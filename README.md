This dataset is available in kaggle. Here, I've shown the basic summary analysis what we've to do in any analysis as a first step. You'll know how to import python data analysis
libraries and how to use those. You'll learn how to read csv files, drop columns from a dataset,add a new column in a dataset, how to parse year,month or day from datetime object. 
Also you'll know the benefits of using groupby() function in many cases and finding descriptive summaries like max,min,mean, value counts etc.
